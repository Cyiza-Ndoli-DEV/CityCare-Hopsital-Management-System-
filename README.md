### üìã About The Project

**CityCare** is a high-fidelity, interactive front-end prototype for a modern clinic or hospital management system. It has been meticulously designed to serve as a comprehensive demonstration for a development team, showcasing a rich user interface, complex component interactions, and a clear vision for the final product.

This project is **front-end only** and uses mock data to simulate a live environment. There is no backend or database connected. Its primary purpose is to provide a clear, functional blueprint for developers to build upon.
